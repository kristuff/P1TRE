## RFT-00001 - Common sense

Sec §        | Definition
----         | ------------
`§1`         | Activities that are **not legal** are **illegal**. Activities done **illegally** are **illegal**. **Illegal** activities are **illegal**. Don't do that.
`§2`         | **Illegal** activities, even with ***good*** intentions, are **illegal**. Don't do that.
`§3`         | **Illegal** activities, all the more with ***bad*** intentions, are **illegal**. Don't do that.
`§101`       | Judging people **other than by their actions** is bullshit. If you do that you're an **asshole**
`$102`       | You **MUST** respect everyone (except **APTs 👺💀**, and even less **APTs-NT 👺☢️💀** of course, see rev1 [RFT-nt-01337](/TATTTKB/RFT__Rules_For_Trolling/README.md#rft-01337-nt---trolling-activities-nt-nuclear-threat-edition)).
`§0640`      | **Everything** that is public is public. **Everything** that is private is private. Removing `id_rsa` from that repo would be great. 
`§777`       | **Permission** to modify this section *is* granted, but it's **not possible** because the key is broken (see [RFT-00001 .§0640](/TATTTKB/RFT__Rules_For_Trolling/README.md#rft-00001---common-sense)).
`§4777`      | **Don't** do crazy things.
`§6666`      | **Donald TR0LL** & co *(codename `APT002` 👺💀)* *should* read [RFT-00001 Common sense .§1](/TATTTKB/RFT__Rules_For_Trolling/README.md#rft-00001---common-sense), [RFT-00001 Common sense §3](/TATTTKB/RFT__Rules_For_Trolling/README.md#rft-00001---common-sense) and ***MUST*** stop!!
`§666666`    | **Vlad TR0LLING** & co. *(codename `APT001`/`APT-nt-001` 👺☢️💀)* *should* read [RFT-00001 .§3](/TATTTKB/RFT__Rules_For_Trolling/README.md#rft-00001---common-sense), [RFT-00001 Common sense .§/../../../../777UKRAINI](#rft-00001---common-sense) and ***MUST*** stop!!
`§66666666`  | **Elon TR0LL** *(codename `APT003` 👺💀)* *should* read   [RFT-00001 .§1](/TATTTKB/RFT__Rules_For_Trolling/README.md#rft-00001---common-sense), [RFT-00001 .§2](#rft-00001---common-sense), [RFT-00001 .§3](/TATTTKB/RFT__Rules_For_Trolling/README.md#rft-00001---common-sense) and ***MUST*** stop!!

## RFT-00021 - FTP Protocol (Full Trolling Protocol) *~u1-rev21*

Sec §         | Definition
----          | ------------
`§21`         | Do not use, **unsecure**.
`§1337`       | You can still use with protocol combined with `troll64` or `troll512` encoding, that way it’s **secure** *(well at least in your mind)*.




## RFT-00053 - TNS Protocol (Troll Name System Protocol) 

Sec §         | Definition
----          | ------------
`§53.`        | #REF! `=(WHOIS("Cthulhu",A1))`




## RFT-01337-nt - Trolling activities NT *(Nuclear Threat Edition)*

Sec §       | Definition
----        | ------------
`§1`       | **Anyone** involved in troll activities is a **Troll Actor** (**TA** 😈) or just ***troll*** (`tr0ll`). Troll Actor *can* be **real** or **unreal**. 
`§101`     | **Trolling activities** *can* be **ethical** (***ETA***) or **unethical** (***UTA***), according to troll actor's **color** *within the meaning of the [P1TRE🤡 TACS🪅 (Troll Actor Color System) v5.0](/TATTTKB/TACS__Troll_Actor_Color_System/README.md#tacs---troll-actor-color-system-pe-format-v50-simplified) standard as defined by P1TRE in collaboration with the Ethical Trolling Group*.
`§102`     | A troll who is involved in or **unethical** and/or **illegal** trolling activities even once is considered an **Active Persistent Troll** (**APT😈**). 
`§103`     | **Ethical trolling** is *usually* **legal** and even sometimes encouraged (check in your country). Be aware **IT CAN TURN AGAINST YOU** *(`Reverse<--->Trolling`)*. 
`§109`     | Trolls whose color, *within the meaning of the [P1TRE TACS🪅 (Troll Actor Color System) v5.0](/TATTTKB/TACS__Troll_Actor_Color_System/README.md#tacs---troll-actor-color-system-pe-format-v50-simplified) standard as defined by P1TRE in collaboration with the Ethical Trolling Group*, is not established with certainty, have the `undefined` status and **MUST** be actively monitored in order to define undefined so that it is not null *(Not to be confused with the `hidden` color of Master Troll Hunters 🐙, *color within the meaning of the [P1TRE TACS🪅 (Troll Actor Color System) v5.0](/TATTTKB/TACS__Troll_Actor_Color_System/README.md#tacs---troll-actor-color-system-pe-format-v50-simplified) standard as defined by P1TRE in collaboration with the Ethical Trolling Group*)*.
`§222`     | Ethical trollers **SHOULD NOT** attack other ethical trollers, it's not ethical, it's against common sense, non-productive, bullshit 💩. Ethical trollers are not in competition, everyone can contribute something. Ethical trollers **MUST** respect everyone (except **APTs 👺💀**, and even less **APTs-NT 👺☢️💀** of course, see rev1 [RFT-nt-01337](/TATTTKB/RFT__Rules_For_Trolling/README.md#rft-01337-nt---trolling-activities-nt-nuclear-threat-edition)).
`§666`       | A troll who is involved in **unethical** and/or **illegal** troll activities **even once** is considered an **Active Persistent Troll** (**APT👺**). 
`§999`       | Ethical trollers **MUST** understand, remember by heart, and apply these rules **to the letter as a whole**, to be able to claim the title of *ethical troller*.
